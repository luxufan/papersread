What is relevant context inference?
  Modular technique for flow- and context-sensitive data-flow analysis.
  Does not require the entrire program be memory-resident during the analysis.
  Generate summary transfer function for each function and analysis only on summary transfer function.

What is summary transfer function?
  The sumary transfer function of a method M is the set of dfelms.

What are dfelms? 
  dfelms are data-flow facts together with corresponding alias and type context conditions (inferred by the analysis).
  For points-to analysis, each dfelm has the following forms:
    <relevant context, points-to>,
    points-to represents a pair of the form: 
      <var, object> var is the pointer variable, object is the runtime object that created in program.
    relevant context has the following form:
      <alias context, type context>

How to analyis?
  Phase 0: 
    construct a overestimate call graph, initial call graph by class hierarchy analysis.
    Construct a SCC-DAG via the initial call graph.
  Phase 1:
    Traverses the SCC-DAG in a reverse topological order (bottom-up) (without iteration) and analyze each method assuming parameters and global variables have unknown initial values.
    For each method in SCC, generate the dfelms and propagate the dfelms for call sites. 
    For propagation in the same SCC, propagate until the fixed point is reached.
    After phase 1, the summary transfer function of each method and the points-to solution at each node in the method are expressed in terms of the dfelms. (may have unknown initial values)
  Phase 2:
    traverse the SCC-DAG in a topological order (top-down)
    propagate concrete values of unknown initial values to the entry nodes of methods.
  Phase 3:
    analysis nodes that are not entry node.

How to propagate dfelms?
